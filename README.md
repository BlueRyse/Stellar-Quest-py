# Stellar-Quest-py
Custom solutions (and useful stuff) in python for stellar quest Series 1, 2, 3


-create_account is useful to tackle Series 1 Quest 1, but it's useful in every quest as create_account_script.py lets you create an account with a specific public key.

-payment is useful to tackle Series 1 Quest 2. It lets you make a payment to a specific account of any XLM (only native asset).

-manage_data is useful to tackle Series 1 Quest 3. It lets you add a pair (data_name and data_value) to an account. Hello world :)

-add_signer is useful to tackle Series 1 Quest 4. You can add a new signer (with weight 1) to any account of your choice.
